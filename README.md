# Visualizing early Covid-19 Pandemic

### Based and inspired by DataCamp projects.

The Covid-19 outbreak in early 2020 was bordeline unstoppable and rapid, cases grew at a exponential rate as they were being reported in both China and Rest of the world.

This project is an attempt (a very amateur-ish one) to try visualize the cases using R.

The data is collected from a Open repository(https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) that consolidated data from organisations such as WHO, CDC etc. 

This project is based and inspired by the "Visualizing COVID-19" project on DataCamp.
